## Hardware

I value utility and as a result have an appreciation for some consumer electronics. This is reflected in my tool choices:

### Personal Laptop

After spending the majority of my professional career on MacBooks - I use a Surface Pro 6 to run ... Linux. I use this for general open source development.

- Intel i5-8250U 4 Cores@1.6-3.4GHz
- Samsung 8GB DDR3@1600MHz
- Toshiba 128GB  NVMe

### Budget Build Desktop

I've been continually impressed by the value of AMD's recent offerings. I use this desktop for development focused on Go, Windows, graphics, and security.

- Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB (2x8GB) DDR4@2400MHz
