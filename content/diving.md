This page is dedicated to my interest in diving. I've enjoyed free & scuba diving in New Zealand, Australia, and Pacific Islands.

## Gear

### Buy vs Hire

The following chart illustrates a point of financial return at around 40-60 dives. I've included ongoing costs with buying to account for air-fills and maintenance. Entry and ongoing costs will vary.

The following chart shows how body weight can affect buoyancy. Net position of a column indicates positive/negative buoyancy. Tank buoyancy will change over the course of the dive as air is consumed. A wetsuit will lose buoyancy at depth as it is compressed.

### Total

I feel this setup was relatively good value. It would cost more than double to buy the computer domestically with geographic pricing.

Total: $1731.59AUD
