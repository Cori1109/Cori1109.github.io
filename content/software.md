## Alpaca Desktop

Experimental OSX menu bar widget for Alpaca. Distributed as a BitBar application with Alpaca binary and Launchd daemon. This was built to automate the process of reliable running Alpaca for several hundred engineers.

## Forward Proxy

Minimal forward proxy in 150LOC and using only standard libraries. Useful for development, testing, and learning utilizing a thread pool.

## Lisp

![Lisp REPL](/images/software-lisp.png)

Minimal Lisp interpreter in 75LOC and using only standard libraries excluding the REPL. Inspired by Google Research Peter Norvig's [Lis.py](http://norvig.com/lispy.html). I feel this is a more concise implementation using the Ruby programming language.
