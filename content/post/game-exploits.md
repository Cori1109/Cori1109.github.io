I recently dedicated some time to explore the software security space and gain some hands-on experience through exercises like developing game exploits. I decided to write a game exploit for Valve Software's extremely popular Counter-Strike: Global Offensive primarily because of the availability of existing information.

- Source code leak from 2013 for reference.
- Lots of existing exploit examples.

When taking on projects with lots of unknown elements - I like to focus on a "steel-thread" implementation.

- Exploit functionality to be as anemic as possible.
- Exploit managed from a simple external process.
- Exploit uses the standard Win32 API.

One of the obvious ways the software industry has changed in my career is the proliferation of open-source code through sites like github.com. I'm finding more and more; I use github.com code search similarly to stackoverflow.com to solve programming problems. I spent a significant amount of time reading existing exploit code which mine is based on.

The problem with leveraging "prior-work" is that I wasn't sure how much I had learnt vs copied. This lead to the most valuable part of the exercise; Extracting any generic exploit functionality into a shared library. This was the moment it started to become clear how much I had or hadn't learnt.

- Library: https://github.com/jamesmoriarty/gomem

N.B. I was also really happy with automated exploit testing. Despite it not covering all the functionality, it proved extremely valuable. One of my biggest takeaways from reading exploit code is the lack of testing.
