I recently dedicated some time to explore the software security space and gain some hands-on experience through exercises like developing game exploits. I decided to write an exploit for Valve Software's extremely popular Counter-Strike: Global Offensive primarily because of the availability of existing information.

- Source code leak from 2013 for reference.
- Lots of existing exploit examples.

When taking on projects with lots of unknown elements - I like to focus on a "steel-thread" implementation.

- Exploit functionality to be as anemic as possible.
- Exploit managed from a simple external process.
- Exploit uses the standard Win32 API.

I spent a significant amount of time reading existing code to which I based mine was on. There has been a proliferation of open-source code available through sites like github.com. I'm finding more and more; I use github.com code search similarly to stackoverflow.com to solve programming problems.

- Exploit: https://github.com/jamesmoriarty/gohack

The problem with leveraging "prior-work" is that I wasn't sure how much I had learnt vs copied. As an extension to the exercise, I decided to extract the generic exploit functionality into a shared library. This helped solidify my understanding.

- Library: https://github.com/jamesmoriarty/gomem

Testing proved difficult because the exploit depends on compatibility with a 3rd party binary. I also spent a lot of the time creating stub binaries to test different failure modes. This was paid back when it came to refactoring. In contrast, I found it much easier to write contrived tests for the library.

I also used this exercise to write something material with Golang which I have little experience. Despite Golang being a general-purpose programming language - I found several blog posts worth of issues with its Windows implementation.

- Golang Windows executables and DLLs are binary incompatible:
  - https://github.com/golang/go/issues/32101
  - https://github.com/z505/goDLL
- Standard library bugs with Windows syscalls:
  - https://github.com/golang/go/issues/34474
